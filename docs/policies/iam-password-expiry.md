## Description

Password policies, in part, enforce password complexity requirements. Use IAM password policies to ensure that passwords use different character sets.

CIS recommends that the password policy require at least one uppercase letter. Setting a password complexity policy increases account resiliency against brute force login attempts.

This rule is covered by the [iam-password-expiry](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-cis-aws-iam-terraform/blob/main/policies/iam-password-expiry.sentinel) policy.
