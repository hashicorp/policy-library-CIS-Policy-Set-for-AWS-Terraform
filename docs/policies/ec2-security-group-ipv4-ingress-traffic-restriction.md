## Description

DISCLAIMER - This policy works when all resources of type aws_security_group, aws_security_group_rule and aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule 
have their `cidr_blocks`,`ipv6_cidr_blocks`,`cidr_ipv4` or `cidr_ipv6`  attributes set as a constant value.

This control checks whether an Amazon EC2 security group allows ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22 and 3389. The control fails if the security group allows ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22 and 3389.

Security groups provide stateful filtering of ingress and egress network traffic to AWS resources. We recommend that no security group allow unrestricted ingress access to port 22 and 3389. Removing unfettered connectivity to remote console services, such as SSH, reduces a server's exposure to risk.

This rule is covered by the [ec2-security-group-ingress-traffic-restriction](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-cis-aws-ec2-terraform/tree/main/policies/ec2-security-group-ingress-traffic-restriction-protocol.sentinel) policy when the `prevent_unknown_ipv4_ingress` parameter is passed as `true`.
