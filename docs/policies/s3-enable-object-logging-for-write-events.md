## Description

S3 object-level API operations such as GetObject, DeleteObject, and PutObject are called data events. By default, CloudTrail trails don't log data events and so it is recommended to enable Object-level logging for S3 buckets.

This rule is covered by the [s3-enable-object-logging-for-events](../../policies/s3-enable-object-logging-for-events.sentinel) policy with the `event_type` parameter passed as `WriteOnly`.

## Policy Results (Pass)
